## 📊 Real Case Studies from Old Portfolio

### Case Study 1: The Launchpad
**Category:** Product Vision, Lifecycle Marketing  
**Icon:** 🚀  
**Color:** #7C5CFF

**Tagline:**
"Transforming a static directory into a revenue engine for practitioners"

**Metrics:**
- **+212%** Qualified Leads
- **+38%** Lead-to-Demo Conversion
- **$310K** New Revenue (6 months)

**Challenge:**
A beloved practitioner directory had audience trust but almost zero monetisation. Listings looked pretty yet produced no measurable pipeline. When I first inherited the directory it was a glossy brochure. Practitioners felt proud to be listed, but they could not tie the membership fee to real outcomes. There were no lead capture points, no attribution, and the CRM had no idea who was browsing the directory. Without proof of value renewals were a coin flip and sales conversations turned into discounts.

The brief was clear: turn the directory into an engine that proved value every single month, captured demand the second it appeared, and gave sales a predictable pipeline to close.

**Issues:**
- No measurement beyond vanity page views
- Manual CSV exports for email follow up
- Zero segmentation or nurture for high-intent prospects

**Strategy:**
Architected a full-funnel growth system that recast the directory as a performance product with automation, segmentation, and conversion paths. I reframed the entire experience as a productised acquisition journey. The build combined net-new UX, data architecture, and marketing automation so the directory could sell itself.

**Implementation:**
- Designed new path-to-value with comparison widgets, outcomes copy, and embedded lead capture for every listing
- Implemented a headless sync between the directory, HubSpot, and FluentCRM that scored behaviour in real time
- Launched nurture sequences that reacted to signals—repeat visits, resource downloads, and geo intent
- Delivered weekly revenue stand-ups with cohort and persona level reporting so the team could optimise within hours

**Impact:**
The relaunch produced triple-digit growth in revenue-driving metrics and established a repeatable model for regional expansions. Six months after launch the directory was unrecognisable. Practitioners finally saw deal flow, the sales team knew exactly who to call, and finance could forecast renewals with confidence.

**Results:**
- Qualified leads increased 212% with a 38% lift in lead-to-demo conversions
- Membership renewals jumped 24 points because every provider received automated ROI proof
- Regional expansion blueprint created an additional $310K in attributable revenue

### Case Study 2: The Guardian
**Category:** Automation, Customer Empathy  
**Icon:** 🛡️  
**Color:** #FF8A65

**Tagline:**
"Turning compliance pain into an automated trust-and-sales engine"

**Metrics:**
- **Minutes → Seconds** Time to Compliance
- **+27%** Upsell Conversion
- **-68%** Support Tickets

**Challenge:**
Clinics constantly phoned support to understand certification rules. The experience eroded trust and consumed the team's time. Compliance questions were the number one support issue. Every state, credential, and renewal window had different requirements. Customers were anxious about missing a deadline and agents were digging through spreadsheets to answer the same questions over and over again.

The human cost was enormous: 45% of support capacity disappeared into compliance responses and the team missed obvious upgrade moments because agents were in catch-up mode.

**Issues:**
- Multiple disconnected compliance sources with conflicting updates
- No way to tie a customer's purchases to required credentials
- Support could not spot when a practitioner was eligible for premium offerings

**Strategy:**
Built an intelligent assistant that merged compliance data, purchase history, and nurture automations into a single workflow. I reverse engineered every question I heard and mapped it against data the business already owned. Then I designed an automation stack that answered the question before the customer could send an email.

**Implementation:**
- Centralised state and board requirements inside a structured data warehouse refreshed nightly
- Authenticated experience that surfaces personalised compliance status and next steps when customers log in
- Trigger-based journeys in FluentCRM that automatically send reminders, curated CE options, and one-click upgrade paths
- Escalation workflow that summarises customer context for humans only when intent or risk is high

**Impact:**
I moved the organisation from reactive firefighting to proactive enablement and turned mandatory compliance into a new revenue stream. Compliance moved from cost centre to conversion lever. Customers trusted me with their credential journey and bought deeper into the ecosystem.

**Results:**
- Support tickets related to compliance dropped 68% within two months
- Self-service portal resolves 92% of inquiries in under 30 seconds
- Upsell conversion on compliance-driven recommendations increased 27%
