## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
1. **Don't bury your best metrics** - Lead with them
2. **Don't use vague language** - "significantly increased" → "+212%"
3. **Don't hide your technical skills** - They're your differentiator
4. **Don't separate strategy from execution** - Show you do both
5. **Don't underplay your role** - You built these systems yourself
6. **Don't focus only on tactics** - Show strategic thinking
7. **Don't forget healthcare expertise** - It's valuable specialization

### ✅ Do This Instead
1. **Lead with biggest numbers** - "$310K revenue" in first sentence
2. **Use specific metrics** - "212% increase" not "big growth"
3. **Showcase technical+strategic** - "I design AND build"
4. **Emphasize solo execution** - "Solo operator" = more valuable
5. **Own your achievements** - "I architected" not "helped with"
6. **Balance strategy+tactics** - Show thinking AND doing
7. **Leverage healthcare niche** - "30,000+ practitioners" = scale
