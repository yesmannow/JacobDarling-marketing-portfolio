## The Challenge

Persistent bot attacks and scrapers slowed the storefront, spiked hosting bills, and threatened customer trust.

The team was caught in a losing game of whack-a-mole. Malicious bots pounded wp-login, scrapers hammered the directory, and marketing launches slowed to a crawl whenever attacks spiked. Security and performance were treated separately, so fixes solved one problem and created another.

### Key Issues

- 80% of traffic was non-human noise hitting expensive PHP endpoints
- Average page load ballooned to 5.8 seconds during attacks
- Teams paused campaign launches because they feared downtime
- Reactive security approach couldn't keep pace with threats
- High hosting costs from malicious traffic

## The Strategy

Implemented a multi-layered Cloudflare stack with proactive rules, observability, and performance tuning at the edge.

I moved the fight to the edge. I designed a layered defence that filtered, cached, and monitored before traffic ever touched WordPress.

### Implementation Approach

**Edge Security Layer**
- Deployed Cloudflare WAF with custom rules
- Challenge suspicious behaviour patterns
- Block credential stuffing attempts
- Real-time threat intelligence integration

**Bot Management**
- Rate limiting on sensitive routes
- Bot management tuned to site's content patterns
- Automated challenges for suspicious activity
- Whitelist legitimate crawlers and partners

**Observability & Monitoring**
- Workers KV logs for detailed traffic analysis
- Grafana dashboards for real-time visibility
- Automated alerts piped to Slack
- Custom metrics for security events

**Origin Optimization**
- Object caching at origin
- Image optimization pipeline
- Queue-based background jobs
- Reduced PHP endpoint exposure

## The Impact

Revenue-critical experiences stayed fast, safe, and available—even during coordinated attacks.

Security became an enabler. Marketing could ship promotions during peak traffic knowing the platform would hold.

### Measurable Results

**Security Transformation**
- Blocked 85,000+ malicious hits every month
- Cut server load in half through intelligent filtering
- Zero successful credential stuffing attempts
- Incident response time reduced to under 5 minutes

**Performance Excellence**
- Edge caching pushed cache-hit ratio to 86%
- Conversion-critical page speeds improved by 210%
- Consistent performance during traffic spikes
- Marketing campaigns launch without infrastructure concerns

**Operational Confidence**
- Platform maintains availability during attacks
- Automated playbooks resolve edge anomalies quickly
- Team focuses on growth, not firefighting
- Hosting costs reduced despite traffic growth

## Technologies Used

- **CDN & Security:** Cloudflare WAF, Workers, KV
- **Bot Management:** Cloudflare Bot Management
- **Monitoring:** Grafana, custom Workers KV logs
- **Alerting:** Slack integration for real-time notifications
- **Origin:** Object caching, image optimization
- **Rate Limiting:** Custom rules for sensitive endpoints

## Key Takeaways

1. **Defense at the Edge:** Moving security to the edge prevents malicious traffic from ever reaching origin servers
2. **Security + Performance:** Properly implemented security measures can improve performance through intelligent caching
3. **Observability is Critical:** Real-time monitoring and alerting enable rapid response
4. **Automation Scales:** Automated defenses handle routine threats, freeing humans for strategic work
