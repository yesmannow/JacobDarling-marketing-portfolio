## The Challenge

Leadership made six-figure decisions without reliable attribution. Data lived in silos and nothing reconciled.

Reporting conversations felt like guesswork. GA4, WooCommerce, and the CRM all disagreed on revenue. Finance pulled numbers from QuickBooks, marketing exported spreadsheets, and nobody trusted any of it. Without a shared truth the team flew blind when planning campaigns or forecasting inventory.

### Key Issues

- Duplicate and unclassified traffic sources made attribution meaningless
- Cohort retention was invisible because transactional data never met lifecycle tags
- Executives spent hours reconciling numbers every quarter
- No single source of truth for revenue reporting
- Marketing decisions based on incomplete or conflicting data

## The Strategy

Engineered an analytics pipeline that unified web, CRM, and finance data with rock-solid governance and storytelling dashboards.

I treated analytics like a product. I documented the questions leaders needed answered, then built the plumbing to answer them daily.

### Implementation Approach

**Event Model Architecture**
- Implemented first-party event model in GTM
- 60+ custom events aligned to lifecycle milestones
- Consistent naming conventions across all platforms

**Data Warehouse Integration**
- Streamed orders and subscription events into Snowflake warehouse
- Resolved customer identities across platforms
- Single source of truth for all revenue data

**Data Transformation Layer**
- Authored dbt models for trustworthy revenue, LTV, and funnel views
- Automated QA checks on data quality
- Version-controlled data transformations

**Executive Dashboards**
- Story-first narratives in Looker Studio
- Visualized momentum, risks, and next actions
- Self-service access to key metrics
- Automated daily refreshes

## The Impact

Marketing finally operated with instrumentation-grade clarity and could optimise spend in real time.

Within one quarter marketing decisions shifted from feelings to forecasts. Budget moved to the channels that won, and experiments were decided in days instead of months.

### Measurable Results

**Attribution & Efficiency**
- Attribution accuracy improved by 46 percentage points
- CAC efficiency climbed 32% through better channel allocation
- ROI transparency enabled confident investment decisions

**Operational Excellence**
- Weekly growth council runs on dashboards blending spend, pipeline, and revenue
- Finance reconciles to marketing within minutes—no more midnight spreadsheets
- Data-driven culture replaced opinion-based planning

**Strategic Impact**
- Campaign optimization cycles shortened from months to days
- Budget allocation became data-driven and defensible
- Full-funnel visibility from first touch to revenue

## Technologies Used

- **Analytics Platform:** Google Analytics 4, Google Tag Manager
- **Data Warehouse:** Snowflake
- **Transformation:** dbt (data build tool)
- **Visualization:** Looker Studio
- **E-commerce:** WooCommerce event streaming
- **CRM Integration:** Cross-platform identity resolution

## Key Takeaways

1. **Treat Analytics as a Product:** Document stakeholder questions first, then build infrastructure to answer them
2. **Single Source of Truth:** Unified data warehouse eliminates reconciliation nightmares
3. **Automated Quality Checks:** dbt models with QA prevent bad data from reaching dashboards
4. **Story-First Dashboards:** Visualization should tell a story, not just display numbers
