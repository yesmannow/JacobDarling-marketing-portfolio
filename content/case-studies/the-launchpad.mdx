## The Challenge

A beloved practitioner directory had audience trust but almost zero monetisation. Listings looked pretty yet produced no measurable pipeline.

When I first inherited the directory it was a glossy brochure. Practitioners felt proud to be listed, but they could not tie the membership fee to real outcomes. There were no lead capture points, no attribution, and the CRM had no idea who was browsing the directory. Without proof of value renewals were a coin flip and sales conversations turned into discounts.

The brief was clear: turn the directory into an engine that proved value every single month, captured demand the second it appeared, and gave sales a predictable pipeline to close.

### Key Issues

- No measurement beyond vanity page views
- Manual CSV exports for email follow up
- Zero segmentation or nurture for high-intent prospects
- Practitioners couldn't see ROI from their listings
- Sales team had no visibility into prospect engagement

## The Strategy

Architected a full-funnel growth system that recast the directory as a performance product with automation, segmentation, and conversion paths.

I reframed the entire experience as a productised acquisition journey. The build combined net-new UX, data architecture, and marketing automation so the directory could sell itself.

### Implementation Approach

**Path-to-Value Redesign**
- Designed new path-to-value with comparison widgets and outcomes copy
- Embedded lead capture for every listing
- Created clear differentiation for premium vs. standard listings

**Real-Time Behavioral Tracking**
- Implemented a headless sync between the directory, HubSpot, and FluentCRM
- Scored behaviour in real time based on engagement signals
- Triggered automations based on visit patterns and resource downloads

**Intelligent Nurture Sequences**
- Launched nurture sequences that reacted to signals
- Repeat visits, resource downloads, and geo intent drove personalization
- Automated follow-up based on prospect readiness signals

**Data-Driven Optimization**
- Delivered weekly revenue stand-ups with cohort and persona level reporting
- Team could optimise within hours instead of months
- Clear visibility into what's working and what needs attention

## The Impact

The relaunch produced triple-digit growth in revenue-driving metrics and established a repeatable model for regional expansions.

Six months after launch the directory was unrecognisable. Practitioners finally saw deal flow, the sales team knew exactly who to call, and finance could forecast renewals with confidence.

### Measurable Results

**Lead Generation Transformation**
- Qualified leads increased 212% with a 38% lift in lead-to-demo conversions
- Sales pipeline became predictable and data-driven
- Lead quality improved dramatically through better segmentation

**Retention & Revenue Growth**
- Membership renewals jumped 24 points
- Every provider received automated ROI proof
- Regional expansion blueprint created an additional $310K in attributable revenue

**Operational Excellence**
- Automations eliminated manual CSV exports
- Real-time dashboards replaced weekly reporting delays
- Sales team focused on closing, not data cleanup

## Technologies Used

- **Marketing Automation:** HubSpot, FluentCRM
- **CRM Integration:** Bi-directional sync with behavioral scoring
- **Analytics:** Custom dashboards with cohort analysis
- **Lead Capture:** Embedded forms with smart routing
- **UX:** Comparison widgets and outcomes-focused copy

2. **Automation at Scale:** 400+ workflows handled complexity while maintaining personalization
3. **Proof of Value:** Automated ROI reporting to practitioners increased renewals by showing real business impact
4. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Real-time reporting enabled rapid optimization and confident investment decisions
