## The Challenge

The flagship ecommerce site creaked under growth. Slow pages, checkout errors, and risky deployments limited sales velocity.

Traffic growth outpaced the infrastructure. Pages took nearly six seconds to load, checkout hiccups cost real revenue, and any code change required an all-hands prayer.

### Key Issues

- Legacy LEMP stack lacked object caching and PHP tuning
- Manual FTP deployments regularly introduced regressions
- Error visibility stopped at Apache logs—no observability pipeline
- Scaling challenges during traffic spikes
- Fear of breaking production limited innovation

## The Strategy

Optimised the entire stack—from servers to CI/CD—to create a resilient platform that could ship features without fear.

I treated performance and reliability as a product sprint. I rebuilt the foundation and automated the release process.

### Implementation Approach

**Infrastructure Modernization**
- Provisioned new autoscaling infrastructure
- Tuned PHP-FPM workers for optimal throughput
- Implemented Redis object cache
- Database query optimization

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- Automated smoke tests on every push
- Instant rollback playbooks
- Blue-green deployment strategy

**Observability Stack**
- Instrumented with New Relic for application monitoring
- Sentry for error tracking and alerting
- Uptime monitors feeding shared war room dashboard
- Custom metrics for business-critical paths

**Application Optimization**
- Refactored WooCommerce queries for efficiency
- Queue workers for heavy tasks (PDF generation, emails)
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Database index optimization

## The Impact

Customers experienced a blazing-fast store while the team gained an always-on release pipeline.

The storefront now feels instant, support no longer braces for outages, and marketing can launch without negotiating with engineering.

### Measurable Results

**Performance Transformation**
- Average page load time dropped from 5.8 seconds to 1.2 seconds
- Conversion-critical pages load in under 1 second
- Consistent performance during traffic spikes
- Mobile experience dramatically improved

**Reliability Excellence**
- Checkout failures plummeted 92% thanks to better scaling
- Zero unplanned downtime in 12 months
- Automated health checks catch issues before users do
- Graceful degradation during peak loads

**Development Velocity**
- Deployments happen daily with 99% confidence score
- Feature development accelerated by 3x
- Rollbacks take seconds, not hours
- Team ships fearlessly with safety nets in place

## Technologies Used

- **Infrastructure:** Autoscaling LEMP stack
- **Caching:** Redis object cache, edge caching
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, automated testing
- **Monitoring:** New Relic, Sentry, custom uptime monitors
- **Queue System:** Background workers for async tasks
- **Database:** MySQL with query optimization
- **PHP:** PHP-FPM with performance tuning

## Key Takeaways

1. **Performance is a Feature:** Fast load times directly impact conversion rates and revenue
2. **Automation Enables Confidence:** Automated testing and deployment remove fear from shipping
3. **Observability is Non-Negotiable:** You can't fix what you can't see—instrument everything
4. **Infrastructure as Product:** Treat infrastructure like a product that enables business outcomes
